<p>Sage is a powerful system for studying and exploring many different areas of mathematics.  In this textbook, you will study a variety of algebraic structures, such as groups, rings and fields.  Sage does an excellent job of implementing many features of these objects as we will see in the chapters ahead.  But here and now, in this initial chapter, we will concentrate on a few general ways of getting the most out of working with Sage.</p>
