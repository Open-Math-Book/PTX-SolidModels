<p>Sometimes we wish to investigate smaller groups sitting inside a larger group.   The set of even integers \(2{\mathbb Z} = \{\ldots, -2, 0, 2, 4, \ldots \}\) is a group  under the operation of addition. This smaller group sits naturally inside of the group of integers under addition.  We define a <em class="terminology">subgroup</em> \(H\) of a group \(G\) to be a subset \(H\) of \(G\) such that when the group operation of \(G\) is restricted to \(H\text{,}\), \(H\) is a group in its own right. Observe that every group \(G\) with at least two elements will always have at least two subgroups, the subgroup consisting of the identity element alone and the entire group itself. The subgroup \(H = \{ e \}\) of a group \(G\) is called the <em class="terminology">trivial subgroup</em>.  A subgroup that is a proper subset of \(G\) is called a <em class="terminology">proper subgroup</em>. In many of the examples that we have investigated up to this point, there exist other subgroups besides the trivial and improper subgroups.</p>
