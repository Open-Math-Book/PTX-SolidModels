<p>You may use Sage several different ways.  It may be used as a command-line program when installed on your own computer.  Or it might be a web application such as the SageMathCloud.  Our writing will assume that you are reading this as a worksheet within the Sage Notebook (a web browser interface), or this is a section of the entire book presented as web pages, and you are employing the Sage Cell Server via those pages.  After the first few chapters the explanations should work equally well for whatever vehicle you use to execute Sage commands.</p>
