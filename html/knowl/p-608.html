<p>The main tools used in this proof are the division algorithm and the Principle of Well-Ordering. Let \(G\) be a cyclic group generated by \(a\) and suppose that \(H\) is a subgroup of \(G\text{.}\). If \(H = \{ e \}\text{,}\), then trivially \(H\) is cyclic. Suppose that \(H\) contains some other element \(g\) distinct from the identity. Then \(g\) can be written as \(a^n\) for some integer \(n\text{.}\). Since \(H\) is a subgroup, \(g^{-1} = a^{n}\) must also be in \(H\text{.}\).  Since either \(n\) or \(-n\) is postive, we can assume that \(H\) contains positve powers of \(a\) and \(n \gt 0\text{.}\). Let \(m\) be the smallest natural number such that \(a^m \in H\text{.}\). Such an \(m\) exists by the Principle of Well-Ordering.</p>
