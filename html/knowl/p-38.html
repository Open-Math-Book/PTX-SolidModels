<p>Let us examine different types of statements.  A statement could be as simple as “\(10/5 = 2\text{;}\)” however, mathematicians are usually interested in more complex statements such as “If \(p\text{,}\) then \(q\text{,}\)” where \(p\) and \(q\) are both statements.  If certain statements are known or assumed to be true, we wish to know what we can say about other statements.  Here \(p\) is called the <em class="terminology">hypothesis</em> and \(q\) is known as the <em class="terminology">conclusion</em>.  Consider the following statement: If \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and \(a \neq 0\text{,}\), then  
                
\begin{equation*}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
\end{equation*}

            The hypothesis is \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) and \(a \neq 0\text{;}\); the conclusion is 
                
\begin{equation*}
x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
\end{equation*}

            Notice that the  statement says nothing about whether or not the hypothesis is true. However, if this entire statement is true and we can show that \(ax^2 + bx + c = 0\) with \(a \neq 0\) is true, then the conclusion <!--Style me with CSS--><em>must</em> be true.  A proof of this statement might simply be a series of equations:
\begin{align*}
ax^2 + bx + c &amp; =  0\\
x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x &amp; =  - \frac{c}{a}\\
x^2 + \frac{b}{a}x + \left( \frac{b}{2a} \right)^2 &amp; =  \left( \frac{b}{2a} \right)^2 - \frac{c}{a}\\
\left(x + \frac{b}{2a} \right)^2 &amp; =  \frac{b^2 - 4ac}{4a^2}\\
x + \frac{b}{2a}  &amp; =  \frac{ \pm \sqrt{ b^2 -4ac}}{2a}\\
x &amp; =  \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}.
\end{align*}
